        <td style="font-weight:bold">ph:</td>
        <td>The acidity of the water from 0-14 with 7 being neutral, less than 7 acidic, and more than 7 basic. The World Health Organization(WHO) has recommended the maximum permissible limit of pH from 6.5 to 8.5.</td>

        <td style="font-weight:bold">Hardness:</td>
        <td>Hardness is mainly caused by calcium and magnesium salts. Hardness was originally defined as the capacity of water to precipitate soap caused by Calcium and Magnesium(measure in mg/L).</td>

        <td>Water can have inorganic and even some organic minerals or salts dissolved in it, such as potassium, calcium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides, magnesium, sulfates etc. This measures the total dissolved solids in ppm.</td>

        <td>Chloramines are most commonly formed when ammonia is added to chlorine to treat drinking water. Chlorine levels up to 4 milligrams per liter (mg/L or 4 parts per million (ppm)) are considered safe in drinking water.</td>

        <td style="font-weight:bold">Sulfate:</td>
        <td>Sulfates are naturally occurring substances that are found in minerals, soil, and rocks. They are present in ambient air, groundwater, plants, and food. The principal commercial use of sulfate is in the chemical industry. Sulfate concentration
            in seawater is about 2,700 milligrams per liter (mg/L). It ranges from 3 to 30 mg/L in most freshwater supplies, although much higher concentrations (1000 mg/L) are found in some geographic locations.</td>

        <td style="font-weight:bold">Conductivity:</td>
        <td>Pure water is not a good conductor of electric current rather’s a good insulator. Increase in ions concentration enhances the electrical conductivity of water. Generally, the amount of dissolved solids in water determines the electrical conductivity.
            Electrical conductivity (EC) actually measures the ionic process of a solution that enables it to transmit current. According to WHO standards, EC value should not exceeded 400 μS/cm.</td>

            < 2 mg/L as TOC in treated / drinking water, and < 4 mg/Lit in source water which is use for treatment.</td>

        <td>THMs are chemicals which may be found in water treated with chlorine. The concentration of THMs in drinking water varies according to the level of organic material in the water, the amount of chlorine required to treat the water, and the temperature
            of the water that is being treated. THM levels up to 80 ppm is considered safe in drinking water.</td>

        <td>The turbidity of water depends on the quantity of solid matter present in the suspended state. It is a measure of light emitting properties of water and the test is used to indicate the quality of waste discharge with respect to colloidal matter.
            The mean turbidity value obtained for Wondo Genet Campus (0.98 NTU) is lower than the WHO recommended value of 5.00 NTU.</td>
